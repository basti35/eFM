About Django in general:

"Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages
rapid development and clean, pragmatic design"

Django (1.5) documentation and tutorials:
http://www.djangobook.com
http://www.djangoproject.com

Some basic principles of Django framework:
- Model - View - Control == Architecture
- Business logic should be separated from presentation logic
- Loose coupling - all changes need be done in one place only
- HTML templates and framework code are separated: designers are assumed to be comfortable with HTML, not to be Python programmers
